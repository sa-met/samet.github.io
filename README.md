# My V4 Portfolio (Svelte)

This is the first iteration of my portfolio site.
It is currently in early development and not yet ready for production.
See how it looks at [https://sa-met.vercel.app/](https://sa-met.vercel.app/).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `npm install` or `yarn`), start a
development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
